<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Attesoro was written to help translators translate Java programs more effectively.  
When he was programming TulipChain, Stephen Ostermiller, found that many translators had
a hard time working with the properties files.  Especially when the translator was using
a non ISO-8859-1 language such as Polish or Chinese.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Attesoro is named after the Rosetta stone.  This famous stone had the same writing in three
languages and helped modern scientist decode Egyptian hyroglyphics.  Attesoro is "O' Rosetta" backwards and
Italian it roughly translates to "A Treasure".</p>

<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Several other people have contributed to Attesoro.  Thank you to Carlo Magnaghi for fixing bugs
and writing documentation.  Also thank you to Wojciech Sobczuk for bug reports.</p>
