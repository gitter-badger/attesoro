<h2>Getting the Source</h2>
<p>The first  step in modifying Attesoro is looking at the sources.  There 
are two ways to get the source code.  attesoro.jar contains all the source code.
You can get the source code from the jar file.  Either rename attesoro.jar to
attesoro.zip (different extensions for the same format) and use your favorite
zip file extractor, or use the following command line that comes with the
Java development kit:<br>
<i>jar&nbsp;xfv&nbsp;attesoro.jar</i><br>
The second way to get the source code is through CVS.  The source code is 
checked into the CVS server on the <a href="http://gjt.org/">Giant Java Tree</a>.
You may <a href="http://www.gjt.org/servlets/JCVSlet/list/gjt/com/Ostermiller/attesoro/">browse 
the CVS repository</a> or use your favorite CVS client
to get the source.  Here is the command that will get the source using the
common command line client:<br>
<i>cvs&nbsp;-D&nbsp;":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gjt.org:/gjt/cvsroot"&nbsp;login</i><br>
use password "anoncvs"<br>
<i>cvs&nbsp;-D&nbsp;":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gjt.org:/gjt/cvsroot"&nbsp;checkout&nbsp;java/com/Ostermiller</i><br>
<p>
You will find the source code in the com/Ostermiller/attesoro directory.  Attesoro
also uses some source code from the com/Ostermiller/util directory.

<h2>Translating</h2>
Attesoro itself can be localized.  The properties file to translate is <a href="http://www.gjt.org/servlets/JCVSlet/show/gjt/com/Ostermiller/attesoro/Editor.properties/HEAD">com/Ostermiller/attesoro/Editor.properties</a>.
It is currently only English.  You may use Attesoro to translate itself if you desire.  Once Attesoro
has been translated please send the translation to Stephen so that he can include it in the next release.

<h2>Compiling</h2>
Attesoro comes with a make file that will compile everything.  Usually you can
go to the com/Ostermiller/attesoro directory and type "make".  If that doesn't
work, or if you do not have make, you can compile the java files from that
directory with:<br>
<i>javac&nbsp;-classpath&nbsp;../../..&nbsp;*.java</i><br>
You can either build the jar file using "make" or "jar", or you may run Attesoro
when it is not in a jar file:<br>
<i>java&nbsp;-classpath&nbsp;../../..&nbsp;com.Ostermiller.attesoro.Editor</i><br>
