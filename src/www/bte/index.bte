<p align=center>A free, open source, translation editor for Java programs.</p>

<p>Java programs that support internationalization (i18n) usually use
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">resource 
bundles</a> and keep their translatable Strings in 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html">properties 
files</a>. (See Sun's Java Tutorial on 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/">i18n</a>.)  Unfortunately,
properties files are hard to edit for translators.</p>

<th width="35%">Attesoro's Solution</th></tr>

<tr class=odd><td class=problem>Properties files are stored in
the ISO 8859-1 character encoding which does not support many international 
characters.  International characters have to be escaped with \u0000 style
escape sequences.  Sun recommends a command line tool, 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/tooldocs/tools.html#intl">native2ascii</a>,
to convert a document from a character set to ISO 8859-1 with escape sequences.  
Most translators would rather save documents directly and never have to use a 
command line.</td>

<td class=solution>A translator can enter international characters directly
into Attesoro and Attesoro will save the file in the correct format with escape
sequences.</td></tr>

<tr class=even><td class=problem>The translation for each language is stored in a separate file.  A translator must
constantly swap back and forth between the file in the original language and the translated 
file.</td>

<td class=solution>Attesoro shows the untranslated text and the translator can type the translation directly
below it.</td></tr>

<tr class=odd><td class=problem>When the programmers expand the program and add new strings that need
to be translated, translators may have a hard time figuring out which strings
have not been translated yet.</td>

<td class=solution>Attesoro shows items that have not yet been translated in blue while translated
items are shown in black.</td></tr>

<tr class=even><td class=problem>If a programmer decides that they would like to change the name of a 
translation key, they have to change it in a file for every language.</td>

<td class=solution>Attesoro will change the name of the key in all files at once.</td></tr>

<tr class=odd><td class=problem>When using a text editor, a translator has no choice but to accept all
or none of the changes when saving the file.</td>

<td class=solution>Attesoro displays keys with changed translations in green and allows you
to revert individual keys.</td></tr>
