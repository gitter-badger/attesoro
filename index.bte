<p align=center>A free, open source, translation editor for Java programs.</p>

<p>Java programs that support internationalization (i18n) usually use
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">resource 
bundles</a> and keep their translatable Strings in 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html">properties 
files</a>. (See Sun's Java Tutorial on 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/">i18n</a>.)  Unfortunately,
properties files are hard to edit for translators.</p>

<tr><th width="65%">Java Internationalization Problem</th>

<th width="35%">Attesoro's Solution</th></tr>

<tr><td>Properties files are stored in
the ISO 8859-1 character encoding which does not support many international 
characters.  International characters have to be escaped with \u0000 style
escape sequences.  Sun recommends a command line tool to convert a document
from a character set to ISO 8859-1 with escape sequences.  Most translators
find this confusing.</td>

<td>A translator can enter international characters directly
into Attesoro and Attesoro will save the file in the correct format with escape
sequences.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Each language is stored in a separate properties file.  This makes life
difficult for the translator because s/he must constantly swap back and forth
between the file in the original language and the translated file.</td>

<td>Attesoro shows the untranslated text directly
above the area in which the translated text should be typed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>When the programmers expand the program and add new strings that need
to be translated, translators may have a hard time figuring out which strings
have not been translated yet.</td>

<td>Attesoro shows a list of all translatable strings
and displays the ones that have not yet been translated in blue.</td></tr>

<tr><td>If a programmer decides that they would like to change the name of a 
translation key, they have to change it in a file for every language.</td>

<td>Attesoro lets you change the name of the key once and saves the changes
in the file for each language.</td></tr>

<tr><td>When translating in a text editor, have no choice but to accept all
or none of your changes when you save the file.</td>

<td>Attesoro displays keys with changed translations in green and allows you
to revert individual keys.</td></tr>
