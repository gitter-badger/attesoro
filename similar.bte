<p>Resource Bundle Manager is a capable program with some features not available in Attesoro.
It puts comments on all translated items that include meta data such as who did the translation and when
the translation was done.  It can create groups for items to be translated.  It also has a nice search feature and it can show statistics including
number of untranslated items for each language.</p>
<p>Like Attesoro, it is written in Java.  It has
a similar look and feel.  Its website contains complete documentation including a tutorial.</p>
<p>It does however, have some significant disadvantages to Attesoro:
<ol>
<li>It is harder to start because it is not packaged in an executable jar file.  The documentation gives a
command line to use.  Even worse, the command line is incorrect because the download does not contain
RBManager.jar in the lib directory, but rather in the main directory.  Translators may have a hard time
getting the program started.</li>
<li>The existing properties files for your project must be imported into Resource Bundle Manager (it
can't just open them directly).</li>
<li>If some keys have not been translated to all languages before the import,
Resource Bundle Manager will not notice this and will claim that all files have been translated.</li>
<li>Only one line is given for translations.  New lines are removed from multi-line translations.</li>
<li>When adding a key, Resource Bundle Manager adds the key with the same text to every language
rather than adding it to the base and letting it inherit.</li>
<li>Once you edit a translation file Resource Bundle Manager, the program does not support editing
the file in another editor.  Any additions made by another program will not be noticed unless the
comments on the properties are also carefully modified.</li>
<li>The file open dialog does not remember the last directory from which a file was opened.</li>
<li>The software does not appear to be actively maintained.  The documentation contains an email
address of the author, but the email to that address bounces.</li>
</ol>
